       <p>My name is Jerry Bribiesca and I am an IT Manager for a Real Estate Law Firm in Arlington, TX.
           I have been in IT for over 15 years and have worked in a variety of positions across small to large organizations.
           My free time as of late has been consumed by my 6 year old son. He loves to keep us on our toes and keeps Daddy busy with video games!
        <br>

        I have enjoyed being in this class so far, I am learning a lot of new technologies that I did not know before.
        I am hoping the course will continue to get me the knowledge needed to help fill a role in my office.
